## Overview
Using the standardized test scores and data associated with the schools in a district, the performance trends and patterns of the schools was investigated and presented to the school board and superintendent. However it was discovered that the source data had been tampered with, specifically the 9th grader's test results from Thomas High School. In an attempt to get a more accurate analysis, the Thomas High School 9th graders were omitted and the analysis was rerun. This report focuses on the changes that occurred as a result of omitting the Thomas High School 9th graders.

## Results
### District Summary
- The percent of students who passed their math test from across the district decreased by 0.1%.
